# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- The plugin now supports namespaced dictionary files, moving beyond the previous flat structure. ([#14](https://github.com/ChristianIvicevic/intl-watcher/pull/14)) by [@ChristianIvicevic](https://github.com/ChristianIvicevic)

  - Automatically creates new namespaces and nests translation keys within them.
  - Removes unused nested keys and completely deletes namespaces if they become empty.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Support AST-based detection of translation functions. by [@ChristianIvicevic](https://github.com/ChristianIvicevic)

  The previous implementation only relied on raw identifiers to find variables that are the result of calling known translation hooks. With the new implementation we're applying a type-safe way of finding them which makes it easier to support alternate ways of translations.
